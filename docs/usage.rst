   from password_strength_checker import check_strength, check_leaked

   # Check password strength
   password = "P@ssw0rd123!"
   strength = check_strength(password)
   print(f"Password strength: {strength}")

   # Check if password is leaked in the RockYou dataset
   is_leaked = check_leaked(password)
   if is_leaked:
       print("This password has been leaked!")
   else:
       print("This password is safe.")
